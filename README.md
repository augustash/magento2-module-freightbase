# magento2-module-freightbase
Freight shipping setup boilerplate.

Generic base fields such as
  freight_class,
  must_ship_freight,
  declared_value,
  freight_length,
  freight_width,
  freight_height
  
Reference internal 'EXAMPLE CARRIER' directory for how to build out an api integration off of the base module. This is a fully working integration with R&L Freight Shipping.
